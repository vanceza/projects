- Put all repo-specific info into one file, preferably a non-bash one?
- Add per-project descriptions
- 'project list' is getting too big. Add a notion of making projects 'invisible' where they don't show up in project list.
- Test github create again, fix if needed.
- Bash/zsh completion
- Feature: Check write permissions for SSH git remote
- Feature: Make 'project doctor' faster
- Bug: Make 'project doctor' less flaky--right now read test sometimes fails due to opening up so many SSH connections
